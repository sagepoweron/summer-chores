### Description
Someone has a list of summer chores they have to do every Saturday. There are a lot of chores for them to do and naturally get more tired throughout completing their tasks. If they get too tired, they may have to take a break and go to sleep before completing their chores.

They have a strict routine, which follows in order:

1. Mowing the yard
2. Weedeating the edges of the house and fence line
3. Trimming the hedges
4. Collect fallen wood for summer night fires
5. Water the garden

If they manage not to get tired and fall asleep while doing their chores, they have successfully completed their chores. Also, there's never a chance of the person falling asleep before mowing the yard.
